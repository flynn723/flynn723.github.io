<p>I worked at Causeforce LLC. for a year and developed and maintained over twenty websites. Among other websites I solely launched the largest and most important website brand <a href="http://to17.conquercancer.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=to17_home">Ride Canada.</a>I created tabular, listing, slideshow, team and personal page templates. I filtered XML files and used AJAX to asynchronously load data about teams, riders and participants and parsed the data to show results, fundraising amounts and more. I also customized the entire fundraising process. Among other websites at Causeforce LCC. I launches Surf City 10 which is a Wordpress site.</p>
