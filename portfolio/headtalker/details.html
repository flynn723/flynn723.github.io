	<p><a title="HeadTalker" href="https://headtalker.com" target="_blank">HeadTalker.com</a> is a one of a kind Crowdspeaking platform.&nbsp;Users can create a campaign with a Linkedin, Facebook,&nbsp;Twiter or Tunblr account. Users have full campaign&nbsp;customization abilities. HeadTalker admins have a custom&nbsp;backend where all the site details are readily available with&nbsp;full details of all the campaigns and users. The user back-end&nbsp;allows creators to see their draft, pending and published campaigns. Campaigns creators can perform updates and users&nbsp;can comment with Facebook on campaigns. Every category&nbsp;page has a JS ajax load more ensuring scale-ability.</p>
	<p>In my beginning programming days I created a startup called <a href="http://headtalker.com" target="_blank">HeadTalker</a> with two other friends. We coined the term "Crowdspeaking", which is similar to crowdfunding but instead of users adding funds to a project users add "social reach". This is a WordPress platform allows users to create crowdspeaking campaigns, buy and sell social reach in a marketplace and participate in campaign giveaways.Here's an example campaign: https://headtalker.com/campaigns/battle-net/</p>
